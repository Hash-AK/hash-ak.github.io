## The Server : Purpose And Background
Before I start explaining the steps, i need to explain **_why_** and **_how_**. 
So as i mentioned, this server's purpose is to serve in a makerspace to host files, using a Samba, host local Git, note-taking apps, etc. The project started in summer 2024. We started making a basic server running on old laptops. But due to the fact that a laptop, well is supposed to _sit on lap_ and not sit in place to run a server, we are going to switch to other devices. That's why I'm starting this blog : to explain the project Server 2.0, from 0 to (i hope) 100%.

_The laptop running v1.0 of the server we made_

In the following blog posts i will explain what we are doing, the problem we've met, solutions, etc.  
## Acknowledgments
I highly thank the following peoples:
