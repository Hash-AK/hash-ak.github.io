Hello everyone! I'm Hash-AK! I'm starting this blog on GitHub Sites to share my progress in different field of computer science! 
My current ongoing project is the making of a server for a makerspace. I will post progress at a (well, _i hope so_ ^^') consistent rate. 
Will you're waiting, you can check my GitHub account at [Hash-AK](https//github.com/hash-ak) (not much yet too :P)
I may also post my work on trying to make some Android 4.4.2 boxes run mainstream Linuxes.
Geek stuff, you know :P

## Any questions/feedback? 
As this is a static website, there's no comment section _yet_, but feel free [to contact me at my GitHub, @Hash-AK](https://github.com/Hash-AK).
