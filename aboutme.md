My name is Hash-AK
I'm a tech person, a Linux user/aficionado and an amateur server maker. I'm also a Rubik's Cube solver and a gamer. I play _Asphalt Legend Unite_ and _F1 2018_.  
Im also interested in cybersecurity and _IT_ in general.

Im a Linux user since summer 2023 and an amateur server builder since July 2024.  
I **REALLY** like the Raspberry Pi SBC line.  
This is my blog to post about stuff I like!
