My website, hosted with Github Site and generated from MarkDown to HTML using [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).  
I post here about different things, from [a server I'm making at a makerspace](https://hash-ak.github.io/2024-11-24-Purpose-of-the-makerspace-server/) to other personal projects, like [my journey trying to install Linux on some Amlogic-based antroid TV boxes](https://hash-ak.github.io/2024-12-12-Android-Boxes-Introduction/).  

I may also use different pages to host pure html, for example for [hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com)'s YSWS (You Ship We Ship) programs, or simply because I don't want to pay for a hosting service. Or make pages show-casing some of my other [GitHub repos](https://github.com/Hash-AK?tab=repositories), like my riced Ubuntu.

I hope this humble blog can entertain and serve you! I'm having a lot of fun making it!
